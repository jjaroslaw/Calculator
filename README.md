Hi! I present you calculator written in Java. I hope, it would help you to implement its functions in your projects.

The calculator has simple math functions:
- adding
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

Additionally, I have implemented:
- square
- qube
- square root
- reverse
- the opposite of numer function

Calculator also has:
- an additional small screen to display the operation
- removing the content of a large screen buton
- removing the content of a large and small screen button
- prevention of divide by zero
- it's not possible to enter several commas
- possibility of resizing calculator frame
- possibility of maximize
- mouseover effect on buttons

I have put special attention to design, so calculator looks modern and minimalist.
